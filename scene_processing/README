To run the live classifier:

1) Live classifier assumes that your Kinect is at a constant height from ground and at a constant vertical orientation. If you are running it for the first time or have changed either of the 2, you need to calibrate. Do rosrun scene_processing GUITransform and rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui and make the Z axis(blue) align with vertical and origin at ground level. Then select Done. This will save globalTransform.bag which contains the camera transformation and will be used by the live segmenter

2) do rosrun openni_camera openni_node

3) do rosrun scene_processing live_segment_computeFeats . It will publish labeled clouds the topic /scene_labler/labeled_cloud . Check the pointtype in src/includes/point_types.h . check ../polar_scene to see of we used this module to create a package which moves robot to a keyboard
